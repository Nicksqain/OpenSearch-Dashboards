# Contributing to OpenSearch Dashboards

OpenSearch is a community project that is built and maintained by people just like you. We're glad you're interested in helping out. There are several different ways you can do it, but before we talk about that, let's talk about how to get started.

Before you read this markdown and start contributing, we advise you to read [ONBOARDING.md](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/ONBOARDING.md)

## First Things First

**When in doubt, open an issue** - For almost any type of contribution the first step is opening an issue. Even if you think you already know what the solution is, writing down a description of the problem you're trying to solve will help everyone get context when they review your pull request. If it's truly a trivial change (e.g. spelling error), you can skip this step -- but as the subject says, when it doubt, [open an issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues).

**Only submit your own work** (or work you have sufficient rights to submit) - Please make sure that any code or documentation you submit is your work or you have the rights to submit. We respect the intellectual property rights of others, and as part of contributing, we'll ask you to sign your contribution with a "Developer Certificate of Origin" (DCO) that states you have the rights to submit this work and you understand we'll use your contribution. There's more information about this topic in the [DCO section](#developer-certificate-of-origin).

## Ways to Contribute

### Bug Reports

A bug is when software behaves in a way that you didn't expect and the developer didn't intend. To help us understand what's going on, we first want to make sure you're working from the latest version. Please make sure you're testing against the [latest version](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards).

Once you've confirmed that the bug still exists in the latest version, you'll want to check to make sure it's not something we already know about on the [open issues GitHub page](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues).

If you've upgraded to the latest version and you can't find it in our open issues list, then you'll need to tell us how to reproduce it. Please provides us with as much context and information as possible (e.g. OS and browser version).

### Feature Requests

If you've thought of a way that OpenSearch Dashboards could be better, we want to hear about it. We track feature requests using GitHub, so please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues) which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

### Documentation Changes

If you would like to contribute to the documentation, please do so in the [documentation-website](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website) repo.

### Contributing Code

As with other types of contributions, the first step is to [**open an issue on GitHub**](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues/new/choose). Opening an issue before you make changes makes sure that someone else isn't already working on that particular problem. It also lets us all work together to find the right approach before you spend a bunch of time on a PR. So again, when in doubt, open an issue.

Once you've opened an issue, check out our [Developer Guide](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for instructions on how to get started.

_Note_: Since you are a beginner, we advise you to start with simple issues.

For this there is a special label "<font color="SlateBlue">**Good first issue**</font>"

Warning! If you have selected an issue and want to get started, check if the issue is free. If for it has already been assigned <br> and there is no pull request for a long time, ask that user using @ (e.g @nickname) if he/she is willing to concede to you.

If the issue has recently been created and there are no appointees, then feel free to write in a comment that you are ready to take on the issue.

Feel free to create an issue if you have not been able to work out the installation, or a bug within the project. Also feel free to ask on the issue page if you are solving a problem but can't figure out the structure of the project.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

OpenSearch is an open source product released under the Apache 2.0 license (see either [the Apache site](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or the [LICENSE.txt file](./LICENSE.txt)). The Apache 2.0 license allows you to freely use, modify, distribute, and sell your own products that include Apache 2.0 licensed software.

We respect intellectual property rights of others and we want to make sure all incoming contributions are correctly attributed and licensed. A Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight mechanism to do that.

The DCO is a declaration attached to every contribution made by every developer. In the commit message of the contribution, the developer simply adds a `Signed-off-by` statement and thereby agrees to the DCO, which you can find below or at [DeveloperCertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/).

```
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the
    best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open
    source license and I have the right under that license to
    submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole
    or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless
    I am permitted to submit under a different license), as
    Indicated in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including
    all personal information I submit with it, including my
    sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed
    consistent with this project or the open source license(s)
    involved.
```

We require that every contribution to OpenSearch is signed with a Developer Certificate of Origin. Additionally, please use your real name. We do not accept anonymous contributors nor those utilizing pseudonyms.

Each commit must include a DCO which looks like this

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@email.com>
```

You may type this line on your own when writing your commit messages. However, if your user.name and user.email are set in your git configs, you can use `-s` or `--signoff` to add the `Signed-off-by` line to the end of the commit message.

Fill in your personal details as well as an email that is public on github:

```
git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"
```

_Note_: If you want to set up this data only for a specific repository then do it without the `--global` parameter:

```
git config user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
git config user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"
```

## First pull request

Let's look at what you need to create your first Pull Request!

To fully work with the repository, you need to know how to use git
But to solve a simple issue, and create a pull request for it, you only need to know a few important git commands:

After you have done a fork and cloned the repository, you can modify the code and save it to the index.

But before all this, make sure you are on the main branch by calling the command in the repository directory:

```
git branch
```

The terminal will show a list of branches, with the current branch shown as '*' (e.g. *main)

If you only see one branch in the list main, you are doing the right thing

We recommend that you create a branch for each pull request of the same issue and only if you are on the main branch.
To do this, switch to the main branch:

```
git checkout main
```

_Note_: only create a new branch if you are on the main branch! And if you want to save commit history for another pull request, only then can you create a branch from any other branch

We changed the code, now we want to save the changes to a new branch that will be included in the pull request, so let's create a new branch and switch to it.

Creating a branch:

```
git branch <new-branch-for-pr>
```

Switching to the branch created:

```
git checkout new-branch-for-pr
```

_Note_: the previous two commands can be replaced by one:

```
git checkout -b new-branch-for-pr
```

The `-b` flag allows you to switch to a branch by creating it

You have switched to the created branch, now you can add the files that were changed to the index and do a `commit`:
Before doing so, let's check the status of our changes:

```
git status
```

_Note_: The `git status` command allows you to see what status our files are in

If you have created a file, you will see that it is `untracked`.
If you modified an existing file, you will see the status as `not staged`.

To add files to the list to be added to commit, run the command:

```
git add <src>
```

`<src>` is the path to the file. Executing `git status` will show all paths

_Note_: Text editors have a built-in git system. There you can control the status of changes

For example in VS code you can open the **Source Control** panel with the shortcut:

```
 Ctrl + Shift + G
```

If you have changed several files, you can add them with one command:

```
git add .
```

We have added all our changes to the index, now we can "Save" our changes by making a commit:

```
git commit -s -m "My first commit and commit message"
```

With this command, we initialize all our files that we've changed into a commit.

**Warning!**

The `-s` flag is required! It is required for the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).
It will sign your commit with the data you added to the git config.
Be sure to read the [DCO](#developer-certificate-of-origin).

The `-m` flag is also required! This is needed to succinctly describe changes to your files. Please keep your descriptions short and to the point.

Once you've committed, you need to submit your changes to a remote repository (forked repository):

```
git push -u origin new-branch-for-pr
```

The `git push` command transfers all local changes to the remote repository, in this case we have specified `origin`.

The `origin` is our remote repository (forked repository) that is copied and located on your github account.
There is also a source for `upstream` - but this is a read-only repository (fetch/pull).

You can see all the sources with the command:

```
git remote -v
```

We have dealt with the selected source. Let's move on to the `-u` flag.

The `-u` flag in git `push origin -u` (or `git push -u origin`) sets the branch on the remote repository as "upstream" for the local branch. This means that the next time you use git push without specifying the remote branch name and local branch name, Git will automatically send changes to the branch on the remote repository that is set to upstream.

For example, if you are working on a local new-branch-for-pr and want to push changes to a remote repository on a branch with the same name, you can use:

```
git push -u origin new-branch-for-pr
```

This will tell Git that the local new-branch-for-pr branch is upstream to the remote origin/new-branch-for-pr branch. Next time you push into this branch, you can simply use:

```
git push
```

Once you have done a git push, go to your forked repository page. You will see a notification that a new branch has been added and an opportunity to make a pull request. Click on the green "Compare & pull request" button.

Describe your pull request. Also use `#` in Issues Resolved to specify an issue that can be resolved by your changes. (e.g #3027)

To set to checked in the Check List, insert `x` in []. Check result in preview mode.

Done! You have done a great job! Check the completed pull request form and create the pull request.

## Changelog

OpenSearch maintains version specific changelog by enforcing a change to the ongoing [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file adhering to the [Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format. The purpose of the changelog is for the contributors and maintainers to incrementally build the release notes throughout the development process to avoid a painful and error-prone process of attempting to compile the release notes at release time. On each release the "unreleased" entries of the changelog are moved to the appropriate release notes document in the `./release-notes` folder. Also, incrementally building the changelog provides a concise, human-readable list of significant features that have been added to the unreleased version under development.

### Which changes require a CHANGELOG entry?

Changelogs are intended for operators/administrators, developers integrating with libraries and APIs, and end-users interacting with OpenSearch Dashboards and/or the REST API (collectively referred to as "user"). In short, any change that a user of OpenSearch might want to be aware of should be included in the changelog. The changelog is _not_ intended to replace the git commit log that developers of OpenSearch itself rely upon. The following are some examples of changes that should be in the changelog:

- A newly added feature
- A fix for a user-facing bug
- Dependency updates
- Fixes for security issues

The following are some examples where a changelog entry is not necessary:

- Adding, modifying, or fixing tests
- An incremental PR for a larger feature (such features should include _one_ changelog entry for the feature)
- Documentation changes or code refactoring
- Build-related changes

Any PR that does not include a changelog entry will result in a failure of the validation workflow in GitHub. If the contributor and maintainers agree that no changelog entry is required, then the `skip-changelog` label can be applied to the PR which will result in the workflow passing.

### How to add my changes to [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)?

Adding in the change is two step process:

1. Add your changes to the corresponding section within the CHANGELOG file with dummy pull request information, publish the PR
2. Update the entry for your change in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and make sure that you reference the pull request there.

### Where should I put my CHANGELOG entry?

Please review the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) document. There you will see all the ### tags with the name of the section for entries.

**Features/Enhancements** - If you have created a `new feature` issue and made a PR with weighty functionality, this is the ideal place for your entry

**Tests** - add any tests for general code coverage by tests. Usually these are issues with labels: `test:bwc`, `test:functional`, `test:integration`, `test:unit`

**Bug Fixes** is the ideal place for your entry if you have made a PR fixing a bug, usually issues with the `bug` label

**Documentation** - the ideal place to entry if you have changed any documentation (usually .md). These are usually issues with the `docs` label

**Refactoring** is the ideal place for entry if you have refactored, for example rewritten types (TypeScript). Usually there is a label `refactor` in the issue

## Review Process

We deeply appreciate everyone who takes the time to make a contribution. We will review all contributions as quickly as possible. As a reminder, opening an issue and discussing your change before you make it is the best way to smooth the PR process. This will prevent a rejection because someone else is already working on the problem, or because the solution is incompatible with the architectural direction.

During the PR process, expect that there will be some back-and-forth. Please try to respond to comments in a timely fashion, and if you don't wish to continue with the PR, let us know. If a PR takes too many iterations for its complexity or size, we may reject it. Additionally, if you stop responding we may close the PR as abandoned. In either case, if you feel this was done in error, please add a comment on the PR.

If we accept the PR, a [maintainer](MAINTAINERS.md) will merge your change and take care of backporting it to the appropriate branches ourselves. For the backporting process, once the PR is merged a [maintainer](MAINTAINERS.md) will label it with the appropriate target branch then the backport workflow will do the rest. For example, the `backport 1.x` label will be added to the PR that is to be backported to `1.x`. The backport branches are named in the form `backport/backport-<original PR number>-to-<base>`. These branches will be cleaned up by an auto delete workflow once the backport PR is merged. If documentation is required, a [maintainer](MAINTAINERS.md) will label the PR with the `needs-documentation` label which will then create an issue in the [Documentation Website repo](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website). Please follow-up and provide support on the documentation issue to ensure it is successfully closed.

If we reject the PR, we will close the pull request with a comment explaining why. This decision isn't always final: if you feel we have misunderstood your intended change or otherwise think that we should reconsider then please continue the conversation with a comment on the PR and we'll do our best to address any further points you raise.
